# BitGames
BitGames is a web app where users can play mini-games.

## App Functions
To be able to play the games on the site, the user must first make an account. Once
that is done and the user signs in, they will be sent to the home page where they can
select which games they want to play. I haven't decided on how many games to include in
the app, but I want to make at least 3 games to choose from. After the user picks a game,
they would use the mouse or keyboard to play the game. For specific games, high scores and
previous scores will be kept. Each game will have its own logical code, and some games will
have an AI opponent.

## Features
1. User Login and Authentication
2. Database for Users
3. Database for Scores
4. Logical code for games
5. Interface window

## Home Page
The home page will be the first page the user sees when they visit the site. The page contains
a welcome message to the user telling them what the site is about and what games they can find. 
At the bottom of the page, games will be recommended for the user to choose.

## Game Page
This page is a game page that the user specifically selected. If the user clicks the "Games" link on
the navbar, they will be taken to a page with a list of games to choose and play. The game page contains
a tutorial teaching the user how to play the game and a score/leaderboard to keep the score of the user and
other users. The center of the page is the window where the game is played.
